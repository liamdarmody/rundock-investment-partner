# Risk Profile

The limits Lead Partner and Risk Manager check every proposal against, and that the dashboard checks the portfolio against as you change them. Fractions are decimals from 0 to 1, so 0.08 is 8%.

These are sample limits, a starting point rather than advice. Set your own on the dashboard's Risk control panel.
